# About this Guidebook

Welcome to the guidebook on AI Ethics & Governance 👋

This guide has been produced to accompany the online training programme at the Alan Turing Institute. It is currently a work-in-progress, so if you are reading this please feel free to have a look around—I like to work with the "garage door open".
