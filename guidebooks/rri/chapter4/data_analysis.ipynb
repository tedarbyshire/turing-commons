    "# Data Analysis\n",
    "This module will introduce and examine the stage of 'exploratory data analysis'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than focusing on the statistical or technical techniques employed in modern data science though, we will approach this stage with a bias-aware perspective. However, we will make use of Jupyter notebooks—a popular tool in data science—to aid our exploratory data analysis[^jupyter] by visualising some data. You do not need to be familiar with either Python or Jupyter Notebooks if you just want to gain an understanding of how social, cognitive, and statistical biases interact and affect downstream stages in the research and innovation lifecycle. But the code is presented for those who wish to get more \"hands-on\".\n",

    "## What is Exploratory Data Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis is a crucial stage in the project lifecycle. It is where a number of techniques are employed for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the dataset and any relationships that exist between the relevant variables. Among other things, this could mean,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describing the dataset and important variables\n",
    "- Identifying missing data and outliers, and deciding how to handle them\n",
    "- Cleaning the dataset\n",
    "- Provisional analysis of any relationships between variables\n",
    "- Uncovering possible limitations of the dataset (e.g. class imbalances) that could affect the project\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover each of these sub-stages of EDA briefly, but to reiterate, our primary focus in this section is on the risks and challenges that stem from a variety of biases that can cause cascading issues that affect downstream tasks (e.g. model training).\n",
    "\n",
    "## COVID-19 Hopsital Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this section we have created a synthetic dataset that contains X records for fictional patients who were triaged (and possibly admitted) to a single hospital for treatment of COVID-19. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has been designed with this pedagogical task in mind. Therefore, although we relied upon plausible assumptions when developing our generative model, the data are not intended to be fully representative of actual patients. Our methodology for generating this dataset can be found here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to import our data and the software packages that we will use to describe, analyse, and visualise the data. The following lines of code achieve this, and also loads our data into a DataFrame using the Pandas package:"
